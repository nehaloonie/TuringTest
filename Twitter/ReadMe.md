## Things to do:

(a)  An iOS app with part 1 specs below  
(b)  An iOS app with part 2 specs below  (assuming part  1  is done)
(c)  An Android app with part 1 specs below  
(d)  An Android app with part 2 specs below  (assuming part  1  is done)

Cats Part 1:
(required skill : twitter login, using twitter api, don’t worry about  any ui/ux or list control).

Cats - Create an app that displays stories from the facebook page. https://twitter.com/picturecats. The app will have 2 screens. 
1) Screen 1 with a “Connect to Twitter” button.
2) Screen 2. Uses Twitter API to fetch the Tweets and display API result such as number of posts, image url, etc

Important points :-
1) No need for any data caching.  Live fetch of data is okay.
2) Use the best practices and latest APIs. For android support v9+.
3)  Don’t worry about UI/UX or list control.

Cats Part 2:
(required skill : using list control, ui/ux)

Create the following app, which is an improvement over boo part 1:
Cats - Create an app that displays stories from the twitter page. https://twitter.com/picturecats. The app will have 3 screens. 
1) Screen 1 with a “Connect to Twitter” button.
2) Screen 2. Uses Twitter API to fetch the stories and display them in a list. The UX should be as close to Twitter app as possible. Only show “Tweet Replies count” in this screen. 
3) Screen 3. Shows a tweet with its replies. Allow a user to reply to the tweet. Reply to the tweet should be  pushed to twitter. 

Important points :-
1) Assume this app is to go live to millions of users and pay close attention to Networking, Caching etc. Use the fact that this picturecats twitter page only updates 1-2 times a day. 
2) Use the best practices and latest APIs. For android support v9+. 
3) Write maintainable code assuming more developers will work on it. Proper comments/Logging/etc.
4)  Make sure to have  list  control and good UI/UX.
